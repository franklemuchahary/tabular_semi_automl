# Semi AutoML for Tabular Data

Flask API to allow easy development of baseline models on tabular datasets for Classification and Regression Tasks. The goal of this project is to save the time and effort required to quickly develop a baseline predictive model for various types of tabular datasets. Just upload a csv file, choose the target column, and within a few minutes, the output and evaulation results of the baseline models will be available. 

The framework can currently handle the following:
- Automatic Data Type Detection and Data Cleaning
- Automatic Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
- Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Baseline Classification and Regression Model Building
- Model Evaluation
